## INTRODUCTION

Pro-Vision is a project aimed at bridging the communication gap between business analysts and non-technical clients. By generating simple prototypes based on user requirements, it helps clients visualize their system before development, ensuring maximum customer acceptance. This unique initiative seeks to enhance the usefulness of the final developed system by addressing the challenges faced during requirements elicitation.

# Project Title
This will introduce our final year project which is â€˜taking software requirements from user/client 
through user stories or vision statement and then filling the web form automatically with the help of detected
controls based on our inputs and generating simple prototype against them. It includes project executive 
summary, background, project overview, project objectives. 

# PROJECT OBJECTIVE(s)

The objectives of our project are as follows:

1) To achieve maximum customer acceptance of the software system by providing clear and visual representations through simple prototypes.
2) To enable the development team to work efficiently on a project once a simple prototype is accepted by the user.
3) To minimize the risk of changes that may occur during the development process.
